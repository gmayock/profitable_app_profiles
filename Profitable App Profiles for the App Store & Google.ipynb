    "This project looks at iOS and Android mobile apps from the perspective of an analyst for a company which builds free mobile apps and makes money from ad revenue on those mobile apps. To this end, I analyze free apps by number of users to determine which kinds of apps are likely to attract more users.\n",

    "### Removing non-English apps\n",
    "It's somewhat difficult to remove non-English apps from the Google Play data set as it does not explicitly state the language of the app. \n",
    "\n",
    "The suggested way to address this is to filter out apps with three or more non-standard (ordinal above 127) ASCII characters. This is used as a proxy for foreign language, although due to the pervasiveness of non-standard characters in modern app names - \"Lep's World 3 🍀🍀🍀\" comes to mind, or \"► MultiCraft ― Free Miner! 👍\" - it's not a perfect method.\n",
    "\n",
    "Nevertheless, it is the method I will use at this time. Other methods which were considered but ultimately refused:\n",
    "1. I could use the ASCII characters between 128 and 255 to denote non-English (thus omitting the emojis, etc)\n",
    "2. I could find ranges for the ordinal of the emojis and use ASCII characters between 128 and the ordinal start of the emojis to denote non-English (thus omitting the emojis but including characters like kanji, hiragana, etc).\n",
    "3. I could look for supplementary data sources"
