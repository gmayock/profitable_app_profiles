# profitable_app_profiles
This repository holds code and data for the a project which looks at iOS and Android mobile apps from the perspective of an analyst for a company which builds free mobile apps and makes money from ad revenue on those mobile apps. To this end, I analyze free apps by number of users to determine which kinds of apps are likely to attract more users. 

My goal in this project is to develop a profile or set of profiles for profitable apps on the App Store &amp; Google Play markets. That way, the company's developers have data to inform what kind of apps they build.
